# Personal-Task-Manager

In todayâ€™s world, individuals often need to keep track of various tasks in a structured way. This task manager allows you to do so. 

This application (built in Python), allows users to:
1. Register/Login: If you are a new user, you can create your own username and password (will be hashed). You can log back in if you are a returning user. Each username is unique!
2. Add Task(s): You can create your own tasks like laundry, cooking, working out, cleaning etc.
3. View Task(s): You can view your task(s) and their status (whether they're done or not done)
4. Mark Task as Completed: You can mark a task as completed and the status will change from "Not Done" to "Done"
5. Delete Task: You can delete a task of your choice

There are defined functions for each task. There is a main menu which will be shown after each operation is done. The user can choose to do another operation or log out whenever they need to.
